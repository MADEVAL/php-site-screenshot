PHP-Site-Screenshot

This will take a screenshot of a given site url and save it to the desired output path.

But first, you need cutycapt and xvfb as this script relies on a headless webkit to take the screenshot: https://github.com/jaequery/cutycapt-installer-script-on-ubuntu

usage: http://localhost/capture.php?url=http://www.google.com
